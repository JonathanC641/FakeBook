# Grids: Website Edition

## The Goal
Now that you've had some time to practice styling grids, we're going to take a look at designing something a little bit closer to what you might see when you're out in the depths of the internet. In this lab you won't just be styling html, you'll be working from the ground up to recreate mockups relevant to modern web design. Throughout the lab you'll be recreating mockups based on the websites that you see every day.

## The Lab

In each section of this lab you'll be given a mockup that you need to match. Each section will have a corresponding html and css file that you'll work in. You're responsible for writing html, styling colors, text, spacing, and grid layout.

### Facebook (inspired)
Either you, or someone you know, spends an absurd amount of time on facebook. In this part of the lab we'll be recreating a mockup of a classic facebook timeline. For each of the tasks below you'll be writing html in facebook_mockup.html and styling that html in facebook_mockup.css

#### Step One: Outermost Grid
When you first look at a website, you'll want to develop an intuition for where the outermost grid lies. Look for the highest level of layout on the page. In this example, we'll be looking at the differentiation between the nav bar and the page content. Recreate the basic mockup you see below.
<!-- tell them to use developer tools to match colors? -->

<!-- Insert mockup of small top navbar in dark blue and a lighter main area -->

### Step Two: Nested Grids
As you experienced in the nested grid lab, it is possible to create grid layouts within items of another, higher level, grid. We'll focus on creating the grid within the page content here.

## Step Three: Keep Nesting...

## Step Four: Even more (you guessed it) nesting!

<!-- Questions:
1. difficulty: how much scaffolding should I be giving them? Should I just give them this end product? Is this better for the nested lab?
2. Let them use dev tools on the actual website to match styles?
3. How much concentration on html? should the mockup be filled in with fake fonts?
4. In notes it says they do everything but also to give them sample code, does this mean just html shell?

setting height for an item inside of a column? good/bad practice?
